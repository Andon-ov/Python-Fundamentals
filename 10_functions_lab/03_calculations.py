# 3.	Calculations
# Create a function that receives three parameters, calculates a result depending on the given operator, and returns it. Print the result of the function.
# The input comes as three parameters â€“ an operator as a string and two integer numbers. The operator can be one of the following:  "multiply", "divide", "add", "subtract".
